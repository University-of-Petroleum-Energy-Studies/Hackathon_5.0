For example, when playing a video game, we will often have to remember locations in the game, items to pick up, where we need to go and various other useful points about the game.

In online casino and bingo games, players can chat with others in the game, while playing collaborative video games allows you to bond with others and complete levels together.   </div>

                        <p class="skills__text">Games can also have an interesting benefit in terms of improving a players attention span. By playing games, you develop the ability to notice lots of small details at once and learn to combat impulsiveness. When concentrating on a video game, the player must quickly assimilate lots of conflicting information and learn to focus on the most important things, blocking out the irrelevant information.

                            The players must also know when to act and when to wait, in order to maximise the success of their interactions with the game. For example, when playing blackjack online, a player needs to consider when to take another card and when to stick with their current hand. In a video game

                            <br>They can have health benefits, especially when we are all self-isolating.
                            "When people play video games they actually have a lot of benefits to our emotional health or social health and our mental well-being," Mandryk said.
                            The U of S research looked at all age groups — from pre-literate children through to older adults living in long term care homes — though the primary focus was on 18 to 55-year-olds.
                            Mandryk said they looked at how playing video games can benefit people's emotional and mental state.   </div>
